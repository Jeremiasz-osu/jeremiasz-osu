## About me
Hi, I'm Jeremiasz, an 18 year old vivid osu! player and mapper. I target 100% accuracy, and so I have decompiled osu! and changed the HitResult function to always return 300s. That's my secret :)

My osu! profile can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9536238)!

## My skills
- C# and Rust (destroy non-memsafe languages)
- Reverse engineering highly obfuscated C# apps, as seen [here](https://github.com/Jeremiasz-osu/).
- osu! mapping
- Managing SQL databases, even the biggest ones.

## My achievements
- Ranking an AI Generated [osu! map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1815930#osu/4101154).
- De-obfuscating osu!.
- Full emulation of the osu!auth DLL.
- Made over $9,000 from bug bounties.
